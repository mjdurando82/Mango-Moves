### **_Description_**

#### My dog, Mango, moves on her own toward obstacles. The user must hit the space bar to make her jump over obstacles. The users score increases the further they go in game without hitting an obstacle. The game ends if Mango fails to jump the obstacle. This game was developed to showcase the cutest english bulldog.
